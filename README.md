# personal-web-application-sdk
You can build a web application that runs on your local computer and you can zip it and send it to your friends to share.

Please download the entire directory to your local directory.
Run "startPWA.bat" and follow from there.

Main Points:
- Use any framework for client side development
- Use Nashorn https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nashorn_(JavaScript_engine) for server side development
- Can share very easily in one zip file
- Can manage processing status from console info/log and/or process ID
- Can easily develop your own web-based application and good-bye from command-based processing
